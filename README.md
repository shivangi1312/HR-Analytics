Created a "HR Analytics " Dashboard in Power Bi where the problem statement was to understand the working preference of people in a company, how many people are working from Office and how many are Working from Home. 

ðŸ“Œ Action Plan: 

1. Imported an Excel file into Power BI.
2. Transformed the data in Power Query using a dynamic function which helped in the automation of the process.
3. Created different Measures and Calculated columns as per the requirement.
4. Generated a report on the basis of Presence data, Work from Home, and Sick Leave.

ðŸ“Œ Result: 

1. How many employees were present both from WFH and WFO.
2. Shown the employee's Attendance sheet in percentage form.
3. Created an insight into when the people are present in the office, people take WFH, and how many times they take sick leave.
